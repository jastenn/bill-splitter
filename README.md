### What I Learned

I learned a lot in this project, expecially in using advanced concepts of styled components. In this project I also learn a lot about Providers and Hooks in React. 

### Continued development

I'ld like to become better and be more fammiliar with React and Styled Components. I also would like to know more about Grid, I only knew Flexbox and I think learning Grid would help me a lot as a developer
